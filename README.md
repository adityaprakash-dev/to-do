<h2>While it isn't the prettiest or sleakest, it is the first time I have built a functional application using ReactJS. </h2>

<p>I got introduced to many different skills and tools during this project</p>

<ol>
  <li>Setting up a react app using next JS</li>
  <li>Tailwind CSS (writing CSS from HTML doc is super cool)</li>
  <li>Setting up components</li>
  <li>Basic state management</li>
</ol>

<p>React is a great way to write clean code.</p>
